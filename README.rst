Introduction and mission statement
----------------------------------
Aristotle-MDR is an open-source metadata registry as laid out by the requirements
of the `ISO/IEC 11179:2013 specification <http://metadata-standards.org/11179/>`_.

Aristotle-MDR represents a new way to manage and federate content built on and extending
the principles of leading metadata registries. The code of Aristotle is completely open-source,
building on the Django web framework and the mature model of the 11179 standard, allowing
agencies to easily run their own metadata registries while also having the ability
to extend the information model and tap into the permissions and roles of ISO 11179.

By allowing organisations to run their own independent registries they are able to
expose authoritative metadata along with the governance processes behind its creation,
and by building upon known and open systems agencies, can deliver a stable platform
for the sharing of metadata.

Extensions
++++++++++
Aristotle-MDR aims to be compliant to the core model described within ISO/IEC 11179,
however `a number of extensions are available to extend functionality and add additional content types <https://github.com/aristotle-mdr/aristotle-metadata-registry/wiki/Available-Extensions>`_.


Quick start
-----------

1. Install using the pip package manager::

    pip install aristotle-metadata-registry

#. Add "aristotle_mdr" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'haystack',
        'aristotle_mdr',
        ...
    )

   To ensure that search indexing works properly ``haystack`` **must** be installed before `aristotle_mdr`.
   If you want to take advantage of Aristotle's access-key shortcut improvements for the admin interface,
   make sure it is installed *before* the django admin app.

#. Include the Aristotle-MDR URLconf in your project ``urls.py``. Because Aristotle will
   form the majority of the interactions with the site, and the Aristotle includes a
   number of URLconfs for supporting apps its recommended to included it at the
   server root, like this::

    url(r'^/', include('aristotle_mdr.urls')),

#. Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to create the Aristotle-MDR Database.

#. Install `lessc` for your system (e.g. ``apt-get install node-less``) or
   configure django-static-precompiler to use your LESS pre-processor of choice.
   (This step is not required if you are running from PythonAnywhere)

#. (Optional) Compile the multilingual resource files for improved performance, like so::

     django-admin.py compilemessages

#. Start the development server and visit ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/``
   to see the home page.

For a complete example of how to successfully include Aristotle, see the `tests/settings.py` settings file.

Information for developers
--------------------------

Aristotle-MDR is free open-source software and contributions are welcome on front-end web development,
back-end server development, translation and content creation (such as more documentation).
Review the wiki, open issues and existing documentation to get started.

**If you are looking to contribute**, `a good place to start is checking out the open issues labeled "help wanted" <https://github.com/aristotle-mdr/aristotle-metadata-registry/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22>`_
or reviewing the `documentation <http://aristotle-metadata-registry.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ and `wiki  <https://github.com/aristotle-mdr/aristotle-metadata-registry/wiki>`_ and identifying (and even adding) content that isn't there.
