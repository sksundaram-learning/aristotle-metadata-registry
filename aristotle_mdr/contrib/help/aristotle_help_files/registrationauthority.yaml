        A Registration Authority should encourage consistent processes within the metadata registry,
        through the development and disemination of formal guidelines and procedures.
        <p>A Registration Authority should also faciliate the process of metadata item registration
        within its domain of responsibility by receiving and processing submissions from suitable
        Submitting Organisations.

        <p>Registration authorities are groups of people that have some authority to state
        registration status levels for metadata. These may be committees or agencies with 
        particular goverance arrangements or business units with specific domain knowledge.
        In all cases, Registration Authorities should be groups that have both the expertise
        and governance to approve the correctness and currency of metadata to inform users of the
        metadata registry of the correct standards for use in data collection and discovery.
        </p>
        <p>Within a registry, Registration authorities will have registrars who are tasked with
        performing day-to-day tasks such as reviewing and updating metadata status levels and
        advicing. Within Aristotle-MDR-based registries, Registration Authorities will also have
        a number of managers responsible for adding registrars and assigning their tasks.
