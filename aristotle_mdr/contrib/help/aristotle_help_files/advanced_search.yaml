      <h2>Restricting search with the advanced search options</h2>
      <p>
          The <a href="/search/">search page</a> provides a form that gives users control to filter and sort search results.</p>
      <p>
      <img src="{static}/aristotle_mdr/search_filters.png">
          When searching, the "indexed text" refers to everything crawled by the search engine.
          This always includes names, definitions, version and comments.
          Some items will also include additional text from associated items.
          For example, Data Elements include the text from its related Data Element Concept and Value Domain.</p>
      
      <h3><i class="fa fa-eye fa-fw"></i> Only show public items</h3>
      <p>
          When logged in, selecting this option limits search results 
          to only those items that are publically visible to all users,
          including those without an account.
          This option is only shown to logged-in users as non-logged in
          users only have right to view to public content.
      </p>
      
      <h3><i class="fa fa-users fa-fw"></i> Only show items in my workgroups</h3>
      <p>
          When searching select this box to limit results to only those items that are within a workgroup a user belongs.
          This option is only shown to logged-in users.
      </p>
      
      <h3><i class="fa fa-magic fa-fw"></i> Smart spellcheck and filter removal</h3>
      <p>
          When searching Aristotle-MDR performs spellchecks against search terms, and if there is
          a low number of resutls will recommend an alternate search term.
          <br>
          Along with this, if a search returns zero results, Aristotle-MDR will remove any filters such as
          item type or date restrictions to automatically broaden the search corpus.
          <br>
          Any time the search is changed, such as spelling correction or filter removal, a notification
          will appear under the search bar to let users know.
      </p>
      
      
      <h2>Keyword search shortcuts</h2>
      <p>
          When searching there are a few advanced options available to make searching easier.
          Much like other large scale search engines, these can be entered into any search
          box using the <tt>keyword:search_term</tt> format.
      
      </p>
      
      <h3><i class="fa fa-keyboard-o fa-fw"></i> Narrow search results using field name</h3>
      <p>
          Field names, such as name, or version, can be used to limit results when searching.
          These will force the search engine to only return results where terms appear in those fields.

      <h3><i class="fa fa-puzzle-piece fa-fw"></i> Restrict item types using the <tt>type</tt> keyword</h3>
      <p>
          When searching, you can enter a type along with the name of the object type to further restrict your
          search. The type must not include spaces, which should be removed, or replaced with underscores or hyphens.
          For an even shorter query, type names can be abbreviated to the first letter of each word in the type name.
      </p>
      <p>
          This is the same as selecting options in the <span class="well well-sm"><i class="fa fa-puzzle-piece fa-fw"></i> Item Type</span> dropdown on the search page.
