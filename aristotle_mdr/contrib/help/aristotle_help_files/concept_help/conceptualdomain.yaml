        <P>A conceptual domain may be associated with either a data element concept or a value domain. A conceptual domain is not a
        mandatory association, and there may be a one-to-many relationship between a data element concept and a conceptual domain, or
        a value domain and a conceptual domain.</P>
        <P>Countries of the world can be expressed as a conceptual domain. The concept of countries can be measured by both enumerated
        and non-enumerated value domains. An enumerated value domain may reference the Australian Standard Classification of Countries
        (2011) and provide a four digit code (i.e. NNNN). A non-enumerated value domain may still reference the same classification,
        but collect country names using a textual field instead (i.e Text X[X(99)]. Both the enumerated and non-enumerated value domains could be
        associated with the conceptual domain for countries. The conceptual domain might also be associated with several data element
        concepts which incorporate country as a central theme, such as <em>Person</em> &mdash;<em>country of birth</em>,
        <em>Person</em> &mdash; <em>country of residence</em>, or <em>Person</em> &mdash; <em>country of citizenship</em>.</P>

        <p>Conceptual_Domain is a class, each instance of which models a conceptual domain (3.2.21), 
        a set of value meanings (3.2.141) which may either be enumerated or expressed via a description. 
        Conceptual_Domain is an abstract class, which has two possible subclasses: 
        Enumerated_Conceptual_Domain (11.3.2.2) and Described Conceptual_Domain (11.3.2.4). 
        Every Conceptual_Domain instance must be either an Enumerated_Conceptual_Domain or a 
        Described Conceptual_Domain or a combination of the two.
