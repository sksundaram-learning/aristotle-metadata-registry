        <cite><a href="http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html">
        ISO/IEC 11179-3 Section 11.3.2.9</a></cite>

        <p>Datatype is a class, each instance of which models a datatype (3.1.9), a set of distinct values,
        characterized by properties of those values and by operations on those values.
        For example, the category used for the collection of letters, digits, and/or symbols
        to depict values of a Data_Element (11.5.2.1) determined by the operations that may be performed on the Data_Element.

        This part of ISO/IEC 11179 is intended to accommodate datatypes from datatype schemes specified in external standards.
        It is also intended to accommodate other non-standard datatype schemes.
        Possible standardized datatype schemes include:
          <ul>
            <li>ISO/IEC 9075 (SQL dataype);</li>
            <li>ISO/IEC 11404 (General Purpose Datatypes);</li>
            <li>ISO 21090 Health Informatics datatypes;</li>
            <li>C programming language datatypes;</li>
            <li>XML Schema datatypes;</li>
          </ul>
