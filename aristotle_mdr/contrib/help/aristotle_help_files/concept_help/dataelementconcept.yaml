    brief: A valid pairing of an [[object class]] and a [[property]] to define a measurable
        attribute of the object, idea or event being observed.

        Concept that is an association of a [[Property]] with an [[Object Class]]

    body: >
        <p>A data element concept represents the union of an [[objectclass]] and a
        [[property]]. Examples of data element concepts include concepts such as,
        <em>Person</em> &mdash; <em>date of birth</em>, <em>Person</em> &mdash;
        <em>country of birth</em>, and <em>Person</em> &mdash; <em>religious
        affiliation</em>.</p>
        
        <p>A data element concept is solely a conceptual description
        and does not include values for measurement or collection.
        Values are described by a [[valuedomain]], which in combination with
        the data element concept forms a [[dataelement]].</p>
        
        <p>A [[conceptualdomain]] may also be associated with a data element concept,
        thereby providing meaning to the values associated with the concept.
        A one-to-many relationship may be formed between a data element concept
        and suitable conceptual domains.</p>

        <cite><a href="http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html">

        <p>Data_Element_Concept is a class each instance of which models a data element concept (3.2.29).
        A data element concept is a specification of a concept (3.2.18) independent of any particular
        representation. A data element concept can be represented in the form of a [[data element]] (3.2.28).
        </p>
        <p>A Data_Element_Concept may have a data_element_concept_object_class association (11.2.3.3)
        with zero or one Object_Class (11.2.2.1) and a data_element_concept_property association (11.2.3.1)
        with zero or one Property (11.2.2.2).
        </p>
        <p>The combination of a [[property]] (3.2.100) and an [[object class]] (3.2.88) provides significance 
        beyond either that of the property or the object class. A Data_Element_Concept thus has a 
        Definition (7.3.2.4) independent of the Definition of the Object_Class or the Property.
        </p>
        <p>Every Data_Element_Concept must have exactly one data_element_concept_domain 
        association (11.2.3.2) with a Conceptual_Domain (11.3.2.1), where the Data_Element_Concept 
        supplies a usage for the associated Conceptual_Domain.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> An association between the Data_Element_Concept "Person Country of Residence"
        and the Conceptual_Domain "Country".
