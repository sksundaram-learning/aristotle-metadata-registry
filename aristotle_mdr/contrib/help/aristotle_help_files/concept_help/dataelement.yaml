    brief: A precise way of defining how a measurable attribute of a set of objects
        may be recorded in a system, using reusable metadata components.
    offical_definition: A unit of data that is considered in context to be indivisible.

        <p>A data element represents the union of a [[data element concept]] and 
        a [[value domain]]. The following examples demonstrate how a concept can
        be paired with values to capture detailed information, e.g.
            <em>Person</em> &mdash; <em>date of birth</em>, <em>DDMMYYYY</em>,
            <em>Person</em> &mdash; <em>country of birth</em>, <em> code Australian
                Standard Classification of Countries NNNN</em> and
            <em>Person</em> &mdash; <em>religious affiliation</em>, <em>code Religious
                Affiliation Standard 2012 NNNN</em>.
        </p>
        
        <p>The same data element concept may be paired with various sets of values to
        form different data elements and thereby customising the way information is
        specified for collection. For example the concept of Occupation may be associated
        with a value domain which references the Australian and New Zealand Standard 
        Classification of Occupations and be collected at different digit levels 
        representing the Major Group, Sub-Major Group, Minor Group, Unit Group or Occupation.<p>
        
        <p>Data elements may stand alone or be associated with other item types such
        as [[data element derivation|s]].</p>

        <p>Data_Element is a class each instance of which models a data element (3.2.28),
        a unit of data (3.2.27) that is considered in context to be indivisible.
        </p>
        <p>A Data_Element is considered to be a basic unit of data of interest to an organization.
        It is a unit of data for which the definition, identification, representation, 
        and permissible values are specified by means of a set of attributes.    
        </p>
        <p>A Data_Element is formed when a Data_Element_Concept (11.5.2.2) is assigned a representation. 
        One of the key components of a representation is the Value_Domain (11.5.2.3), i.e., restricted valid values.
